System Requirements
-----------------------

grSim will likely run on a modern dual core PC with a decent graphics card. Typical configuration is:

- Dual Core CPU (2.0 Ghz+)
- 1GB of RAM
- 256MB nVidia or ATI graphics card

Note that it may run on lower end equipment though good performance is not guaranteed.


Software Requirements
---------------------

grSim compiles on Linux (tested on Ubuntu variants only) and Mac OS. It depends on the following libraries:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 2.8+ 
- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org)
- [Qt4 Development Libraries](https://www.qt.io) version 4.8+
- [Open Dynamics Engine (ODE)](http://www.ode.org)
- [VarTypes Library](https://github.com/szi/vartypes)
- [Google Protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf)
- [Boost development libraries](http://www.boost.org/) (needed by VarTypes)

Please consult the [install instructions](INSTALL.md) for more details.

Usage
-----

Receiving data from grSim is similar to receiving data from [SSL-Vision](https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-vision) using [Google Protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf) library.
Sending data to the simulator is also possible using Google Protobuf. Sample clients are included in [clients](./clients) folder. There are two clients available, *qt-based* and *Java-based*. The native client is compiled during the grSim compilation. To compile the Java client, please consult the corresponding `README` file.
